Covid-19-RNA-Classification
Overview
This project involves the classification of RNA sequences from eight SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants. The study employs various machine learning models to achieve accurate classification of these viral sequences.

Datasets
The datasets for each of the eight SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants have been compiled into a single RAR file for convenience. This file, originally consisting of eight individual FASTA files, is available in the Datasets folder.

Included Variants:
Alpha
BA.2.12.1 (Omicron subvariant)
Delta
BQ.1.1 (Omicron subvariant)
BA.1.1 (Omicron subvariant)
Gamma
BA.5.4 (Omicron subvariant)
BA.4.6 (Omicron subvariant)
Code Files
The code for this research is organized into six key files, located in the Codes folder. These files include:

Preprocessing_Data: Scripts for data preprocessing and preparation.
PCA: Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.
SVM_Model: Support Vector Machine model implementation.
KNN_Model: K-Nearest Neighbors model implementation.
Random_Forest_Model: Random Forest model implementation.
CNN_Model: Convolutional Neural Network model implementation.
